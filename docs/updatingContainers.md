# How to update your containers  

From time to time you may have a need to update the containers themselves, primarily this is done for security releases.

## 1. Update docker-compose.yml

The first thing you need to do is to edit your docker-compose.yml file and replace the version of the container with the new one you wish to use.

Navigate to your docker-compose.yml file and open it to edit. On Debian installs it would look like this.
```
  cd /usr/local/archipelago/deploy/archipelago-deployment-live/deploy/ec2-docker
  vi docker-compose.yml
```
You want to change the image line to reflect the name of the new image you wish to use.
    image: "esmero/php-7.4-fpm:1.0.0-RC2-multiarch" might become     image: "esmero/php-7.4-fpm:1.0.0-RC3-multiarch"
  
  Save your change. If use vi like in the above it would look like this
  ```
    :wq
  ```
## Pull the new image/s

Docker Compose will now allow us to grab the new image/s while your current system is running.

```
  docker-compose pull
```

## Stop and restart the container

It is necesary to stop and start the container or the current image will continue to be used. 

```
  docker-compose stop container-name
```
Wait for it to stop. Then bring it back up.

```
docker-compose up -d 
```
It is important to use the -d flag or you will have your live instance stuck in your terminal, you want it to run in the background, -d stands for detached.

### Down and up

If you are more comfortable having the all the containers go down and up you can do that with.

```
docker-compose down
docker-compose up
```
